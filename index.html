      <h2>More about me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Kristina — a full-stack developer interested in building things that are both functional and user-friendly. My interest in programming started a few years ago during school, where I realised how much I enjoyed working with code. I’ve always been drawn to technology, puzzles, and figuring out how things work — whether it’s fixing something or building something from scratch.
      <p>Circumstances led me to start learning web development on my own and ultimately set a goal: to fully transition into a career in tech.</p>
      <p>Since then, I’ve built some projects that helped me grow my skills and confidence — including a webpage for a small business owner, a Windows desktop app for personal use, and a simple web app that lets a group of friends borrow books from each other like a mini-library system. More <a href="./projects.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Right now, I mostly work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and currently learning more about framework Node.js in hopes to broaden my knowledge of both front-end and back-end development. </p>
      <p>I’m looking for opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow as a developer — ideally in a supportive, collaborative environment where solving real problems is part of the everyday work.</p>
      <p>If you want to know more about me, feel free to <a href="#contact">contact</a> me.</p>
